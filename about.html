    <p class="about-text">
      In July, as an initiative to encourage LA Metro ridership, I helped design and code <a href="#">MetroOrDrive</a>, a tool to help commuters save money and time.
      <br/>  <br/>
      At the same time, I worked on a variety of <a href="#">interactive projects</a> that made me realize <i>my favorite thing about product development was design</i>.
      <br/>  <br/>
      In the two years leading up to this moment of revelation, I have <a href="#">cleaned metadata</a> for a startup, <a href="#">scrubbed PHI</a> for a research lab, spent a year trying to <a href="#">automate psychotherapy</a>, and cashiered at a Chinese restaurant with 3.5 stars on Yelp.
      <br/>  <br/>
      Iâ€™m currently finishing my degree in Linguistics and Computer Science at UCLA. Before college, I spent my formative years in Canada exploring beautiful national parks and observing geese from a distance.
      <br/>  <br/>
      I was born and raised in China, where I developed my northerner palate and fondness for authentic street food.
